# seven-weeks-of-fonts

#Project Overview

Manipulating type in expressive, creative ways is an interesting CSS layout challenge, 
and developing the skill of choosing fonts that pair nicely together takes time. Drawing
inspiration from the Yale School of Art’s 100 Days project, we’ll build a new typographic
experiment every week for this module. The end deliverable will be a one page site that shows
the full collection of your type exercises. Take a look at this 100 Days of Fonts project by
designer Do-Hee Kim as an amazing example of what a final deliverable might look like.

To help build typography and layout skills simultaneously, we’ll make our challenges revolve around
working with pre-selected font pairings and text snippets. These will be provided to you each week,
and your job will be to make a responsive and expressive layout using them. What feelings does the copy
convey and how do you express that typographically? How can that be communicated through layout, scale, and color?
